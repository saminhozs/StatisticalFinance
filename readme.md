Quantitative Finance Portfolio
Welcome to my Quantitative Finance Portfolio! This repository showcases my passion for statistical finance, machine learning techniques, and the application of mathematical concepts to build models for investment purposes. As a student graduating in quantitative finance, I aspire to work in the quantitative finance industry, specifically in a hedge fund, in a role as a quantitative researcher. This repository serves as a personal portfolio of the projects I have been diligently working on in my free time.

About Me
I am a dedicated and enthusiastic student with a deep interest in quantitative finance. Throughout my academic journey, I have acquired a strong foundation in mathematical modeling, statistics, and programming. My areas of expertise include:

Quantitative Finance: I possess a solid understanding of financial markets, derivative pricing, risk management, and portfolio optimization techniques.
Statistical Finance: I am well-versed in statistical methods and their application to financial data analysis, including time series analysis, regression modeling, and hypothesis testing.
Machine Learning: I have a keen interest in leveraging machine learning algorithms and techniques to extract insights from financial data, develop predictive models, and make informed investment decisions.
Repository Overview
In this repository, you will find a collection of my personal projects related to quantitative finance. Each project demonstrates my ability to apply various quantitative and analytical techniques to real-world financial problems. The projects cover a wide range of topics, including:

Portfolio Optimization: I have implemented and experimented with different portfolio optimization strategies to achieve optimal risk-return trade-offs. These strategies include mean-variance optimization, risk parity, and factor-based models.
Asset Pricing Models: I have explored and implemented well-known asset pricing models, such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT), and multifactor models.
Risk Management: I have developed models and methodologies to quantify and manage various types of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk.
Algorithmic Trading: I have designed and implemented trading algorithms using quantitative techniques, such as trend-following strategies, mean-reversion strategies, and statistical arbitrage.
